| Language, spelling and grammar | Be careful how you use your byte symbol(B). m = mili, M = mega, b = bit, B = byte. MB is a megabyte, not mb. |
| Description of the experiments | Good. Could use a bit more elaboration. How was the time measured? |
| Conclusions drawn from the results | Nice graphs and metrics. Decent conclusions |
